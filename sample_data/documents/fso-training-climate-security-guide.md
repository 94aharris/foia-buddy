## Module 1: Climate Change as a Security Threat Multiplier

### Understanding Climate Security

Climate change does not create conflicts in isolation but exacerbates existing vulnerabilities:

- **Resource Scarcity:** Competition over water, arable land, and fisheries
- **Migration and Displacement:** Climate-induced population movements straining social systems
- **Economic Disruption:** Impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods
- **Governance Challenges:** Overwhelmed institutions unable to respond to climate shocks
- **Regional Instability:** Cross-border tensions over shared resources

### Case Study: Sahel Region

**Background:** The Sahel has experienced a 0.8°C temperature increase and 30% reduction in rainfall since 1970.

**Security Impacts Observed:**
1. **Resource Competition:** Farmer-herder conflicts intensified as grazing land diminished
2. **Extremist Recruitment:** Terrorist groups exploited grievances among climate-displaced populations
3. **Migration Pressures:** 5+ million internally displaced, straining urban centers
4. **State Fragility:** Governments unable to provide basic services in climate-affected areas

**U.S. Diplomatic Response:**
- Integrated climate considerations into security assistance programs
- Supported regional climate adaptation initiatives (Great Green Wall)
- Enhanced early warning systems for climate-related instability
- Coordinated development and security approaches

**Lessons for FSOs:**
- Climate analysis should inform political and security reporting
- Early identification of climate-migration-conflict nexus enables preventive diplomacy
- Whole-of-government approach essential (State, USAID, DOD coordination)

## Module 2: Assessing Host Country Climate Vulnerability

### Vulnerability Assessment Framework

FSOs should use a structured approach to assess host country climate risks:

#### Physical Exposure
- What climate hazards affect the country? (sea-level rise, drought, extreme weather)
- Which regions/populations most exposed?
- What is the timeline for climate impacts?

#### Sensitivity
- How dependent is the economy on climate-sensitive sectors (agriculture, tourism)?
- What is the state of critical infrastructure?
- Are there vulnerable populations (coastal communities, subsistence farmers)?

#### Adaptive Capacity
- Does the government have climate policies and institutions?
- What are resource constraints for adaptation?
- What is the technical and financial capacity?
- Is there international support available?

### Key Indicators to Monitor

**Political Stability Indicators:**
- Frequency of climate-related protests or civil unrest
- Government responsiveness to climate disasters
- Elite discourse on climate issues (acknowledgment vs. denial)

**Economic Indicators:**
- Agricultural output trends
- Climate-related insurance costs
- Infrastructure damage from extreme weather
- Tourism sector impacts

**Social Indicators:**
- Internal and cross-border migration patterns
- Public health impacts (heat stress, vector-borne diseases)
- Food and water security metrics
- Climate-related displacement figures

### Reporting Requirements

**Standard Political-Economic Reporting:**
All political and economic sections should include climate dimensions in:
- Annual Political Overview

## Module 9: Reporting Best Practices

### Climate Integration in Standard Cables

**Political Section Reporting:**

When reporting on political developments, consider climate dimensions:
- Are climate impacts affecting public opinion or protests?
- How are political parties positioning on climate issues?
- Is climate change affecting governance capacity?

**Example: Political Instability Report**

Instead of: "Farmers protesting in capital over economic conditions."

Write: "Farmers from drought-affected regions protesting in capital over economic hardship. Third consecutive year of below-average rainfall has reduced agricultural output by 40%, contributing to rural unrest. Government response perceived as inadequate by farming communities. Climate dimensions of agricultural crisis merit continued monitoring as potential driver of political instability."

**Economic Section Reporting:**

- How is climate affecting key economic sectors?
- What are government climate policies affecting business environment?
- What climate-related investment opportunities exist?

**Consular Section Reporting:**

- Are climate events affecting American citizens?
- What climate-induced migration trends are emerging?
- How is climate affecting travel advisories?
