---

## Summary

Embassy Male reports on the Maldivian government's increasing focus on climate-induced migration planning as sea-level rise threatens the nation's long-term habitability. President Muizzu's administration is developing a comprehensive "Climate Migration Framework" that could create opportunities for U.S. technical assistance and regional leadership on climate displacement issues. The government seeks international partnerships for both domestic adaptation and potential future migration pathways. This cable assesses implications for U.S. policy and recommends engagement strategies.

## Background

The Republic of Maldives, consisting of 1,190 coral islands with an average elevation of 1.5 meters above sea level, faces existential threats from climate change. Recent developments:

- **IPCC AR6 Projections:** Under medium-emissions scenarios, sea-level rise of 0.5-1.0 meters by 2100 would render 80% of current land area uninhabitable
- **National Assessments:** Maldivian Ministry of Environment estimates that maintaining current population distribution will require $8.8 billion in adaptation infrastructure through 2050
- **Political Shift:** President Muizzu's 2023 election marked a policy shift toward acknowledging that adaptation alone may be insufficient
- **Regional Context:** Maldives joins Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Marshall Islands in exploring "migration with dignity" frameworks

## Maldivian Government Climate Migration Framework

### Three-Pillar Approach

Embassy obtained advance briefing from Foreign Minister Zameer on the framework, scheduled for official release in September 2024:

**Pillar 1: Maximize Domestic Adaptation (2024-2040)**
- Consolidate population on 10-15 highly-engineered "resilience islands"
- Invest $2.4 billion in seawalls, land reclamation, and elevated infrastructure
- Reduce inhabited islands from current 200 to approximately 15 fortified locations
- Seek international financing through Green Climate Fund and bilateral partners

**Pillar 2: Regional Migration Pathways (2030-2050)**
- Negotiate "climate mobility partnerships" with India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia
- Establish Maldivian diaspora communities with maintained citizenship
- Develop skill-based migration programs focused on hospitality, maritime, and technology sectors
- Preserve Maldivian cultural identity through diaspora institutions

**Pillar 3: International Sovereignty Solutions (2040+)**
- Explore legal frameworks for "virtual statehood" if physical territory becomes uninhabitable
- Maintain UN membership and international legal standing
- Preserve Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) rights and maritime resources
- Establish "Government in Residence" agreements with partner nations

### U.S. Engagement Requested

Foreign Minister Zameer specifically requested U.S. assistance in three areas:

1. **Technical Expertise:** Engineering assessments for resilience island development; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers consultation
2. **Legal Framework Development:** International law expertise on climate displacement and sovereignty preservation; George Washington University Law School has expressed interest in partnership
3. **Regional Dialogue Facilitation:** U.S. convening role for South Asian climate migration discussions

## Regional Implications and Dynamics

### South Asian Context

**India's Position:**
- Has privately indicated willingness to accept limited Maldivian migration (est. 50,000-100,000 over 20 years)
- Concerned about broader regional precedent (Bangladesh, coastal Indian states)
- Views climate migration cooperation as soft power opportunity
- Requests that any U.S. engagement coordinate with Indian initiatives

**Sri Lanka's Considerations:**
- Facing own climate displacement challenges (coastal erosion, drought-induced internal migration)
- Limited capacity to accept external climate migrants
- Interested in regional burden-sharing mechanisms

**Bangladesh Factor:**
- Maldives framework closely watched in Dhaka
- Bangladesh faces potential displacement of 20-30 million people by 2050 (World Bank estimates)
- Any Maldives precedents will influence Bangladesh's diplomatic approach
- India particularly sensitive to Bangladesh migration implications

### Small Island Developing States (SIDS) Coordination

Maldives coordinating with Pacific SIDS on common approaches:

- **Tuvalu-Australia Agreement (2023):** 280 Tuvaluans annually granted special migration pathway; viewed as model by Maldives
- **Rising Nations Initiative:** Maldives, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Antigua developing common legal frameworks for sovereignty preservation
- **U.S. Pacific Islands Leadership:** Pacific SIDS view U.S. engagement positively; opportunity for U.S. to extend leadership to Indian Ocean

## U.S. Policy Implications

### Opportunities

1. **Climate Diplomacy Leadership:** Demonstrating U.S. commitment to climate-vulnerable nations strengthens credibility in climate negotiations
2. **Regional Influence:** Positive engagement on sensitive issue where China has been largely absent
3. **Legal Precedent-Setting:** Helping develop international frameworks for climate displacement aligns with U.S. values
4. **Technical Assistance:** Low-cost, high-impact engagement through existing programs (USACE, USAID)
5. **Multilateral Coordination:** Opportunity to coordinate with India, strengthening bilateral partnership

### Challenges and Sensitivities

1. **Domestic Migration Politics:** Any perception of "climate refugee" pathways to U.S. could face domestic political challenges
2. **Precedent Concerns:** Framework for Maldives (population 500,000) could be invoked by much larger climate-affected populations
3. **Resource Constraints:** Adaptation financing requests likely to be substantial
4. **Sovereignty Complexities:** Legal questions around statehood without territory lack clear international framework
5. **Regional Dynamics:** Need to coordinate closely with India, avoid appearance of competing approaches

## Assessment

### Embassy Analysis

Post assesses that Maldivian climate migration planning represents serious, pragmatic long-term thinking rather than immediate crisis response. Key observations:

- **Timeline:** Government not seeking large-scale migration in near term; framework focuses on 2030-2050 timeframe
- **Prioritization:** Domestic adaptation remains primary focus; migration planning is acknowledgment of uncertainty
- **Realism:** Government aware that international community has limited capacity/willingness for large-scale climate migration
- **Leadership Opportunity:** Maldives positioning itself as thought leader on climate displacement issues among SIDS

**Threat of Inaction:**
- If U.S. and partners do not engage constructively, Maldives may turn to alternative partners (China has shown recent interest)
- Lack of early planning increases risk of future unmanaged migration flows
- Erosion of international legal frameworks around climate displacement

### Recommended U.S. Response

**Positive but Calibrated Engagement:**
Post recommends U.S. offer technical and diplomatic support while carefully managing precedent implications and coordinating with regional partners.

## Budgetary Implications

Recommended engagement can be accomplished within existing resources and modest new allocations:

- **Technical assessments:** $200,000 (USACE, within existing OBO budget)
- **Academic partnership:** $500,000 (USAID or State Educational and Cultural Affairs)
- **Regional dialogue convening:** $150,000 (State South and Central Asian Affairs)
- **USAID preliminary assessment:** $1.5 million (existing climate adaptation funds)

**Total estimated new funding requirement:** $2.35 million over 12 months

This represents cost-effective engagement on high-visibility climate issue affecting 40+ SIDS nations globally.
