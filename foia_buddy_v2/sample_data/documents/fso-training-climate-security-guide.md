## Module 1: Climate Change as a Security Threat Multiplier

### Understanding Climate Security

Climate change does not create conflicts in isolation but exacerbates existing vulnerabilities:

- **Resource Scarcity:** Competition over water, arable land, and fisheries
- **Migration and Displacement:** Climate-induced population movements straining social systems
- **Economic Disruption:** Impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods
- **Governance Challenges:** Overwhelmed institutions unable to respond to climate shocks
- **Regional Instability:** Cross-border tensions over shared resources

### Case Study: Sahel Region

**Background:** The Sahel has experienced a 0.8Â°C temperature increase and 30% reduction in rainfall since 1970.

**Security Impacts Observed:**
1. **Resource Competition:** Farmer-herder conflicts intensified as grazing land diminished
2. **Extremist Recruitment:** Terrorist groups exploited grievances among climate-displaced populations
3. **Migration Pressures:** 5+ million internally displaced, straining urban centers
4. **State Fragility:** Governments unable to provide basic services in climate-affected areas

**U.S. Diplomatic Response:**
- Integrated climate considerations into security assistance programs
- Supported regional climate adaptation initiatives (Great Green Wall)
- Enhanced early warning systems for climate-related instability
- Coordinated development and security approaches

**Lessons for FSOs:**
- Climate analysis should inform political and security reporting
- Early identification of climate-migration-conflict nexus enables preventive diplomacy
- Whole-of-government approach essential (State, USAID, DOD coordination)

## Module 2: Assessing Host Country Climate Vulnerability

### Vulnerability Assessment Framework

FSOs should use a structured approach to assess host country climate risks:

#### Physical Exposure
- What climate hazards affect the country? (sea-level rise, drought, extreme weather)
- Which regions/populations most exposed?
- What is the timeline for climate impacts?

#### Sensitivity
- How dependent is the economy on climate-sensitive sectors (agriculture, tourism)?
- What is the state of critical infrastructure?
- Are there vulnerable populations (coastal communities, subsistence farmers)?

#### Adaptive Capacity
- Does the government have climate policies and institutions?
- What are resource constraints for adaptation?
- What is the technical and financial capacity?
- Is there international support available?

### Key Indicators to Monitor

**Political Stability Indicators:**
- Frequency of climate-related protests or civil unrest
- Government responsiveness to climate disasters
- Elite discourse on climate issues (acknowledgment vs. denial)

**Economic Indicators:**
- Agricultural output trends
- Climate-related insurance costs
- Infrastructure damage from extreme weather
- Tourism sector impacts

**Social Indicators:**
- Internal and cross-border migration patterns
- Public health impacts (heat stress, vector-borne diseases)
- Food and water security metrics
- Climate-related displacement figures

### Reporting Requirements

**Standard Political-Economic Reporting:**
All political and economic sections should include climate dimensions in:
- Annual Political Overview

## Module 9: Reporting Best Practices

### Climate Integration in Standard Cables

**Political Section Reporting:**

When reporting on political developments, consider climate dimensions:
- Are climate impacts affecting public opinion or protests?
- How are political parties positioning on climate issues?
- Is climate change affecting governance capacity?

**Example: Political Instability Report**

Instead of: "Farmers protesting in capital over economic conditions."

Write: "Farmers from drought-affected regions protesting in capital over economic hardship. Third consecutive year of below-average rainfall has reduced agricultural output by 40%, contributing to rural unrest. Government response perceived as inadequate by farming communities. Climate dimensions of agricultural crisis merit continued monitoring as potential driver of political instability."

**Economic Section Reporting:**

- How is climate affecting key economic sectors?
- What are government climate policies affecting business environment?
- What climate-related investment opportunities exist?

**Consular Section Reporting:**

- Are climate events affecting American citizens?
- What climate-induced migration trends are emerging?
- How is climate affecting travel advisories?

## Conclusion

Climate change is fundamentally reshaping the operating environment for U.S. diplomacy. From embassy facility vulnerabilities to host country instability, from energy transitions to migration pressures, climate impacts are increasingly central to our work.

This is not an additional responsibility separate from traditional diplomacyâit is integral to advancing U.S. interests in an era of climate change. FSOs who develop climate competencies will be better equipped to serve effectively, protect U.S. interests, and advance our diplomatic objectives.

**Remember:**
- Climate is a security issue, not just an environmental one
- Early warning and prevention are more effective than crisis response
- U.S. climate engagement enhances our diplomatic credibility
- Embassy resilience protects our people and mission
