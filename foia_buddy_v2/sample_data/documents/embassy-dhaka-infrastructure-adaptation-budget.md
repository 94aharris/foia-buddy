## Executive Summary

The U.S. Embassy Dhaka compound faces critical climate vulnerabilities due to increased monsoon flooding, urban drainage failures, and extreme heat. This document outlines a comprehensive three-year infrastructure adaptation plan with total allocated budget of **$8.7 million** (FY2024-2026) to ensure operational continuity and staff safety in the face of accelerating climate impacts.

**Budget Breakdown:**
- **FY2024:** $3.2 million (Immediate flood protection and emergency systems)
- **FY2025:** $3.8 million (Major facility upgrades and housing improvements)
- **FY2026:** $1.7 million (Green infrastructure and long-term resilience)

This investment responds to the July 2023 flooding event that caused $340,000 in emergency repairs and 4 days of operational disruption. The adaptation plan is projected to avoid $1.2-1.8 million in future emergency costs over the next decade.

## Climate Vulnerability Context

### Historical Climate Impacts on Embassy Operations

**Flooding Events (2020-2024):**
- **July 2023:** Compound flooding from overwhelmed drainage, 4 days partial operations, $340,000 damage
- **August 2022:** Staff housing flooding in Gulshan residential area, 12 families temporarily relocated
- **September 2021:** Power substation failure during monsoon, 18-hour backup generator operation
- **June 2020:** Main chancery basement flooding, archival materials damaged

**Heat-Related Disruptions:**
- **April 2023:** HVAC system failures during 40Â°C+ heatwave, reduced occupancy in chancery
- **May 2022:** Rolling power outages during extreme heat, backup power stressed
- **March 2024:** Record early heat (38Â°C in March), cooling systems operating at 110% capacity

### Climate Projections for Dhaka

**Bangladesh Meteorological Department and NOAA Data (2024-2050):**

**Precipitation Changes:**
- Monsoon rainfall intensity increase: 15-25% by 2040
- Extreme rainfall events (>150mm/24hrs): 2x more frequent by 2035
- Urban flooding risk: HIGH and increasing (inadequate drainage infrastructure)

**Temperature:**
- Average annual temperature: +1.5Â°C by 2035, +2.5Â°C by 2050
- Heatwave days (>40Â°C): Increase from 5 days/year to 15-20 days/year by 2035
- Combined heat-humidity extreme events: Approaching human physiological limits

**Urban Context:**
- Dhaka's drainage capacity designed for 1980s rainfall patterns
- Rapid urbanization reducing natural water absorption
- Groundwater over-extraction causing land subsidence (1-2cm/year)

**Operational Impact Without Adaptation:**
- Projected 15-20 flood-related closure/disruption days per year by 2030
- HVAC and power system failures during critical heat periods
- Staff housing increasingly vulnerable (40% of units in flood-prone areas)
- Estimated emergency repair costs: $800,000-1.2 million annually by 2030

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

**Risk 1: Funding Delays**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (FY2025 budget pending Congressional approval)
- **Impact:** High (delays expose embassy to monsoon season vulnerabilities)
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize FY2024 flood protection (fully funded); prepare contingency plans for FY2025 phasing

**Risk 2: Construction Delays**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (local contractor capacity, material availability)
- **Impact:** Medium (extends vulnerability period)
- **Mitigation:** Early contracting; pre-position critical materials; build schedule buffers

**Risk 3: Climate Impacts During Construction**
- **Likelihood:** High (monsoon season overlaps with some work)
- **Impact:** Medium (work stoppages, safety concerns)
- **Mitigation:** Schedule critical work outside monsoon season; maintain temporary protection measures

**Risk 4: Cost Overruns**
- **Likelihood:** Medium (supply chain, exchange rate fluctuations)
- **Impact:** Medium (scope reductions or additional funding requests)
- **Mitigation:** 10% contingency built into estimates; value engineering; phased approach allows re-scoping

### Climate Risks Beyond 2026

**Scenario Planning:**

**Moderate Climate Scenario (RCP 4.5):**
- Adaptation measures sufficient through 2040
- Additional upgrades needed 2030-2035 (~$3-4M)
- Current site remains viable long-term

**High Climate Scenario (RCP 8.5):**
- Adaptation measures provide protection through early 2030s
- Significant additional investment needed mid-2030s (~$8-12M)
- Potential site relocation consideration by 2035-2040

**Recommendation:**
- Proceed with planned adaptation measures (effective across scenarios)
- Conduct comprehensive site viability assessment in 2028-2029
- Monitor climate trends annually to inform adaptive management

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The U.S. Embassy Dhaka climate adaptation plan represents a comprehensive, cost-effective response to escalating climate risks. The $8.7 million investment over three years will:

- **Protect Staff:** Ensure safety and livable conditions despite flooding and extreme heat
- **Ensure Mission Continuity:** Reduce climate-related disruptions by 95%
- **Demonstrate U.S. Leadership:** Green infrastructure exemplifies climate commitment
- **Provide Financial Returns:** Avoid $2.6-6.6 million in emergency costs over 10 years

### Recommendations for OBO and Department Leadership

1. **Approve FY2025 Funding:** Expedite Congressional notification approval to maintain implementation timeline
2. **Replicate Approach:** Apply Dhaka model to other climate-vulnerable posts (Jakarta, Manila, Male prioritized)
3. **Establish Climate Adaptation Fund:** Create dedicated OBO funding stream for climate adaptation ($50M annually worldwide)
4. **Integrate Climate into Planning:** Require climate vulnerability assessments for all major facility investments
5. **Share Best Practices:** Disseminate Dhaka lessons learned across OBO portfolio

**Climate change is fundamentally altering the operating environment for U.S. diplomatic facilities. The Dhaka adaptation plan demonstrates that proactive, comprehensive adaptation is both feasible and cost-effective. Early investment protects our people, preserves mission effectiveness, and avoids far greater costs down the road.**
