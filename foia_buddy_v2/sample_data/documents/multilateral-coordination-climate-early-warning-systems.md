# Multilateral Coordination: Regional Climate Early Warning Systems Initiative

**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED
**Document Type:** Coordination Memorandum
**Date:** August 15, 2024
**From:** Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES)
**To:** Embassies - South Asian and Southeast Asian Regions
**Subject:** U.S. Leadership on UN Early Warnings for All Initiative - Regional Implementation Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

The United Nations' "Early Warnings for All" (EW4All) initiative aims to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems by 2027. The United States is committed to leading regional implementation efforts in South and Southeast Asia, where 1.5 billion people currently lack adequate climate hazard warnings.

This memorandum outlines the U.S. strategy for multilateral coordination, identifies key partnerships (UN agencies, World Bank, regional organizations), and provides guidance for embassy engagement with host governments. Combined U.S. investment through USAID, NOAA, and State Department programs totals $150 million over three years (FY2024-2026).

**Key Action Items for Embassies:**
1. Brief host governments on EW4All initiative and U.S. support available
2. Assess national early warning system gaps and capacity needs
3. Facilitate partnerships between host country meteorological services and NOAA
4. Coordinate with UN Country Teams and World Bank on integrated approaches
5. Report on host government interest and implementation progress

## Background: The Early Warnings for All Initiative

### Global Context

**UN Secretary-General's Initiative (March 2022):**
- Goal: Universal early warning coverage by 2027
- Focus: Climate-related hazards (cyclones, floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires)
- Investment Required: $3.1 billion globally (World Meteorological Organization estimate)
- Current Gap: One-third of world's population lacks adequate early warning systems

**U.S. Commitment:**
At COP27 (November 2022), the United States pledged leadership role in regional implementation, particularly in:
- South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan)
- Southeast Asia (Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos)
- Pacific Islands (separate initiative coordinated through Honolulu-based programs)

**Rationale for U.S. Leadership:**
1. **Lives and Livelihoods:** Early warnings reduce disaster mortality by 30% and economic losses by 50%
2. **Climate Adaptation:** Early warning systems are cost-effective adaptation investments
3. **U.S. Expertise:** NOAA and USGS possess world-class technical capabilities
4. **Strategic Influence:** High-visibility climate leadership in regions of strategic importance
5. **Disaster Preparedness:** Protects American citizens and interests abroad

By 2027, U.S. support will help protect hundreds of millions of people from climate-related disasters, demonstrate American commitment to climate adaptation, and strengthen partnerships with key nations.

Success requires active embassy engagement: assessing host country needs, coordinating with governments and multilateral partners, overseeing implementation, and ensuring sustainability. OES and USAID stand ready to support embassy efforts with technical expertise, funding, and Washington-level coordination.

Together, we can ensure that every person in South and Southeast Asia receives timely, accurate warnings of climate hazards—saving lives and building resilience to climate change.
