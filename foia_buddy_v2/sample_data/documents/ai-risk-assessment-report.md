# AI Risk Assessment Report
**System:** Automated Document Classification System (ADCS)
**Assessment ID:** RA-2023-ADCS-001
**Date:** July 10, 2023
**Assessor:** Dr. Patricia Lee, Technical Policy Analyst
**Review Board:** Federal AI Technical Review Board

## System Overview

### Purpose
The Automated Document Classification System processes and categorizes incoming government documents for routing and priority assignment. The system handles approximately 50,000 documents daily across 15 federal agencies.

### Technical Specifications
- **Model Type:** Transformer-based text classification
- **Training Data:** 2.3M government documents (2019-2022)
- **Processing Capacity:** 50,000 documents/day
- **Response Time:** <200ms per document
- **Accuracy Rate:** 94.2% (as of last evaluation)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Classification: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Risk Factors Identified

#### 1. Data Sensitivity (High Risk)
- Processes documents containing personally identifiable information (PII)
- Handles classified and sensitive government communications
- Potential for misclassification leading to security breaches

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Advanced encryption for all data transmission
- Strict access controls (need-to-know basis)
- Regular security audits by cybersecurity team

#### 2. Algorithmic Bias (Medium Risk)
- Training data may reflect historical classification biases
- Potential for systematic misclassification of certain document types
- Impact on equitable processing of citizen requests

**Testing Results:**
- 3% variance in accuracy across document source agencies
- No significant bias detected across demographic groups
- Potential improvement needed for multilingual document processing

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Quarterly bias testing with diverse document sets
- Human oversight for documents with confidence scores <85%
- Ongoing retraining with more diverse datasets

#### 3. System Reliability (Medium Risk)
- High processing volume creates single point of failure risk
- System downtime could severely impact government operations
- Dependency on cloud infrastructure

**Current Reliability Metrics:**
- 99.7% uptime over past 12 months
- Average recovery time: 23 minutes
- 3 significant outages in past year

**Mitigation Measures:**
- Redundant processing clusters in multiple data centers
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Regular disaster recovery testing

#### 4. Privacy Concerns (Medium Risk)
- Document content analysis may expose sensitive information
- Potential for unauthorized data access through system vulnerabilities
- Long-term data retention poses ongoing privacy risks

**Privacy Safeguards:**
- Data minimization protocols - only necessary content analyzed
- Automated PII detection and masking
- Regular deletion of processed documents (90-day retention)

## Performance Monitoring

### Current Metrics
- **Accuracy:** 94.2% overall classification accuracy
- **Processing Speed:** 47,000 documents/day average
- **False Positive Rate:** 2.8%
- **False Negative Rate:** 3.0%

### Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time accuracy tracking with alert thresholds
- Weekly performance reports to oversight committee
- Monthly human validation sampling (500 random documents)

## Compliance Status

### Regulatory Compliance
- ✅ FISMA security requirements met
- ✅ Privacy Act compliance verified
- ✅ Federal AI governance framework alignment
- ⚠️ Section 508 accessibility requirements partially met

### Policy Compliance
- ✅ AI ethics committee approval obtained
- ✅ Required training completed for all operators
- ✅ Incident response procedures in place
- ✅ Regular audit schedule established

## Incident History

### Past 12 Months
1. **March 2023:** Brief system outage (2.5 hours) due to cloud provider issue
2. **June 2023:** Misclassification of 47 documents containing SSNs
3. **July 2023:** Performance degradation during peak processing period

### Lessons Learned
- Enhanced monitoring for cloud provider status
- Improved PII detection algorithms deployed
- Load balancing optimization implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. Implement enhanced PII detection algorithms
2. Complete Section 508 accessibility compliance
3. Conduct comprehensive security penetration testing

### Short-term Improvements (1-6 months)
1. Develop multilingual processing capabilities
2. Implement advanced explainability features
3. Establish real-time bias monitoring dashboard

### Long-term Enhancements (6-12 months)
1. Migrate to next-generation classification models
2. Develop automated retraining pipelines
3. Establish cross-agency performance benchmarking

## Budget Requirements

### Current Operations
- Annual operating cost: $1.2M
- Staff requirements: 3 FTE
- Infrastructure costs: $450K/year

### Recommended Improvements
- Security enhancements: $200K
- Bias monitoring tools: $150K
- Accessibility compliance: $75K
- **Total additional investment:** $425K

## Conclusion

The Automated Document Classification System presents a medium-high risk profile that is manageable with proper oversight and continuous improvement. The system provides significant operational benefits that justify continued operation with enhanced safeguards.

### Overall Recommendation
**APPROVE** continued operation with implementation of recommended improvements within specified timeframes.
