**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED
**Document ID:** STATE-2024-CVA-JAKARTA-003
**Date:** March 15, 2024
**Prepared by:** Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO)
**In coordination with:** U.S. Embassy Jakarta, Office of Climate Change

## Executive Summary

The U.S. Embassy Jakarta faces significant climate-related vulnerabilities due to its location in a coastal megacity experiencing rapid subsidence, sea-level rise, and increased flooding frequency. This assessment evaluates infrastructure risks and recommends adaptation measures to ensure operational continuity through 2050.

### Key Findings

- **Critical Risk Level:** HIGH (8.5/10)
- **Primary Threats:** Flooding, subsidence (up to 25cm annually in some areas), sea-level rise
- **Infrastructure at Risk:** Main chancery building, staff housing (40% of units), power substations
- **Estimated Adaptation Cost:** $12.4 million over 5 years
- **Urgent Actions Required:** Flood barrier installation, backup power systems, drainage improvements

## Climate Hazard Analysis

### Sea-Level Rise Projections

Based on NOAA and local Indonesian meteorological data:

- **Current Rate:** 7mm/year (above global average)
- **2030 Projection:** 15-20cm above 2020 baseline
- **2050 Projection:** 35-50cm above 2020 baseline
- **Jakarta Subsidence Factor:** Additional 10-25cm annually in northern districts

**Impact on Embassy Facilities:**

The embassy compound sits at 4.2 meters above current mean sea level. Accounting for both sea-level rise and local subsidence, effective elevation will decrease to approximately 2.5-3.0 meters by 2035, placing the facility within the high-risk flood zone during seasonal high tides and storm surges.

### Flooding and Precipitation Changes

Historical data (2010-2024) shows:

- **Increased monsoon intensity:** 23% increase in extreme rainfall events (>100mm/24hrs)
- **Flooding frequency:** Embassy compound experienced flooding 3 times in 2023 (up from 0.4 times/year average 2010-2020)
- **Drainage capacity deficit:** Current stormwater infrastructure designed for 1985 climate conditions

### Temperature and Heat Stress

- **Average temperature increase:** +1.3°C since 1990
- **Heat wave days (>35°C):** Increased from 12 days/year (1990-2010) to 28 days/year (2015-2024)
- **HVAC system stress:** 34% increase in cooling demand, leading to higher energy costs and equipment failures

## Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment

### Main Chancery Building

**Constructed:** 1989
**Flood Risk:** MODERATE to HIGH

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Ground-floor electrical systems vulnerable to flooding
- Foundation settling due to subsidence (2.3cm differential noted in 2023 survey)
- HVAC systems operating beyond design capacity during heat waves
- Backup generator located in basement (flood-vulnerable position)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Relocate critical electrical infrastructure to second floor ($850,000)
2. Install flood barriers and waterproofing ($1.2 million)
3. Upgrade HVAC systems to higher-capacity, climate-resilient models ($2.1 million)
4. Relocate and elevate backup generators ($450,000)

### Staff Housing Units

**Total Units:** 47
**High-Risk Units:** 19 (40%)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- 19 units in low-lying areas with repeated flood damage
- Mold and indoor air quality issues due to increased humidity
- Septic systems compromised during flooding events

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Elevate or relocate 19 high-risk housing units ($4.8 million)
2. Install individual flood protection measures for remaining units ($380,000)
3. Upgrade drainage systems around all housing areas ($620,000)

### Power and Utilities Infrastructure

**Critical Vulnerabilities:**
- Primary power substation at risk of flooding (flooded once in 2023)
- Backup power fuel storage vulnerable to contamination during floods
- Water treatment plant experiencing capacity issues during droughts

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Elevate power substations and install flood barriers ($980,000)
2. Relocate fuel storage to elevated position ($320,000)
3. Install rainwater harvesting and storage systems ($440,000)

## Operational Impact Assessment

### Current Climate-Related Disruptions (2023 Data)

- **Workdays lost to flooding:** 7 days (partial operations)
- **Emergency evacuations from housing:** 3 incidents affecting 24 staff members
- **Unscheduled facility closures:** 4 days
- **Overtime costs for emergency repairs:** $187,000
- **Temporary housing costs:** $43,000

### Projected Future Impacts (Without Adaptation)

**2030 Scenario:**
- Estimated 15-20 flood-related closure days per year
- 35-40% of staff housing uninhabitable during monsoon season
- Annual emergency repair costs exceeding $500,000

**2040 Scenario:**
- Embassy compound at high risk of permanent flooding during monsoon season
- Potential need for full facility relocation (estimated cost: $85-120 million)

## Adaptation Recommendations

### Tier 1: Immediate Actions (2024-2025) - $3.2 million

1. **Flood Barrier System:** Install perimeter flood barriers around critical facilities
2. **Emergency Power Relocation:** Move generators and fuel storage to elevated positions
3. **Drainage Improvements:** Upgrade stormwater drainage capacity by 50%
4. **Early Warning Systems:** Install flood monitoring and alert systems

### Tier 2: Medium-Term Actions (2025-2027) - $6.8 million

1. **Electrical System Elevation:** Relocate ground-floor electrical infrastructure
2. **HVAC System Upgrades:** Replace aging systems with climate-resilient models
3. **Housing Adaptation:** Elevate or retrofit high-risk housing units
4. **Water Security:** Install rainwater harvesting and emergency water storage

### Tier 3: Long-Term Planning (2027-2030) - $2.4 million

1. **Foundation Reinforcement:** Address subsidence-related structural issues
2. **Green Infrastructure:** Install permeable surfaces, green roofs, bioswales
3. **Resilience Monitoring:** Establish ongoing climate vulnerability monitoring program
4. **Contingency Planning:** Develop alternative facility plans if adaptation proves insufficient

## Recommendations to Washington

1. **Immediate Funding Approval:** Request expedited approval for Tier 1 immediate actions ($3.2M) in current fiscal year
2. **Multi-Year Commitment:** Secure multi-year funding commitment for complete adaptation program
3. **Pilot Program Designation:** Designate Jakarta as pilot site for embassy climate adaptation best practices
4. **Regional Coordination:** Share findings with other Southeast Asian posts facing similar vulnerabilities
5. **Policy Integration:** Incorporate climate vulnerability assessments into all future OBO planning

## Conclusion

The U.S. Embassy Jakarta faces significant and escalating climate risks that threaten operational continuity, staff safety, and diplomatic effectiveness. The recommended $12.4 million adaptation program represents a cost-effective investment compared to emergency repairs, operational disruptions, or eventual facility relocation.

**Immediate action is required.** Delaying adaptation measures will result in exponentially higher costs and risks as climate impacts intensify. This assessment should serve as a model for similar evaluations at other high-risk posts worldwide.
