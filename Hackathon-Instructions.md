## Reminders 

Important Reminders
‚Ä¢
Time is of the Essence: You've only got two hours to bring your AI agent to life! Focus on creating something impactful yet achievable. Think about a specific problem your agent can solve with rapid deployment, whether it's an automation, a unique user interaction, or a creative application.
‚Ä¢
Showcase Agent Power: Prioritize projects that clearly demonstrate the capabilities of an AI agent, minimizing complexity around data and external dependencies. The goal is to highlight the agent's intelligence and ability to act.
‚Ä¢
Build with NVIDIA Endpoints: For speed and deployment, we highly recommend you familiarize yourself with NVIDIA model endpoints at build.nvidia.com/models before the event as it is a requirement to be considered for any prize.
‚Ä¢
Focus on Nemotron for a Dedicated Prize Track: To be competitive, focus on NVIDIA Nemotron family models (e.g., nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2 and llama-3_3-nemotron-super-49b-v1_5. To access the endpoint, click on the view code button at the top right corner.Click the 'code' button in the top right corner to view the code
Nemotron Prize Eligibility:
Innovation and Impact required; simple prompting is not enough.
Focus on agentic workflows like RAG, Code Generation, or other advanced applications.
Judges will prioritize the workflow and Nemotron integration, not UI complexity.
Refer to the get-started tutorials:
Build a Report Generator AI Agent with NVIDIA Nemotron on OpenRouter
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent with NVIDIA Nemotron
Other NVIDIA models are accepted for general prizes, but Nemotron is required for its specific track.

üèÜ Best Use of NVIDIA Nemotron - Prize Track
What is Nemotron Best For?
NVIDIA Nemotron models are purpose-built for agentic AI - the next generation of intelligent systems that don't just answer questions, but reason, plan, and take action. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, Nemotron excels at:

Advanced reasoning and multi-step problem-solving
Function calling to interact with external tools and APIs
Autonomous decision-making within agent workflows
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-based tasks
Multi-agent orchestration where specialized agents work together together
Think beyond chatbots ‚Üí Build agents that coordinate tasks, use tools intelligently, and adapt to complex scenarios.

üéØ Ideal Projects for This Track
Winning projects will showcase true agentic behavior:

Multi-Agent Systems
Build teams of specialized AI agents (like the Report Generator: Research Agent ‚Üí Outline Agent ‚Üí Writer Agent ‚Üí Editor)

Agentic RAG
Systems that intelligently decide WHEN to retrieve information, not just HOW (perfect for domain-specific assistants)

ReAct Pattern Workflows
Agents that Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Observe in loops to solve problems iteratively (like automated debugging or technical support)

Tool-Calling Applications
Leverage Nemotron's exceptional ability to use external APIs and tools (finance analysis, DevOps automation, content creation)

Multi-Modal Agents
Combine Nemotron reasoning with VLMs (visual analysis + logical decision-making)

Agent Simulation & Evaluation
Use Nemotron to generate realistic test scenarios and evaluation pipelines

üöÄ Get Started in 2 Hours

Multi-Agent Research System (lablab.ai): Orchestrated deep research with autonomous agent collaboration
Nemotron Model Suggestions
These powerful and efficient models are perfect for your hackathon project. We encourage you to be among the first to build with our newest suggestions:

üÜï Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-VL
üÜï Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3
Nemotron-nano-9b-v2
Nemotron-super-49b-v1_5
üí° What Judges Are Looking For
Your project should demonstrate:

‚úÖ
Autonomous reasoning - not just responding to prompts
‚úÖ
Multi-step workflows - agents that plan and execute complex tasks
‚úÖ
Tool integration - using external APIs/services intelligently
‚úÖ
Real-world applicability - solving actual problems
‚úÖ
Nemotron-specific strengths - why Nemotron is the right choice
Pro tip: Show the agent's decision-making process in your demo - let judges see it thinking, planning, and acting!

üìö Additional Resources
Developer Forums: Nemotron channel on Discord
Technical Blogs: developer.nvidia.com/nemotron
Full Workshop Repos: Available on GitHub (linked in tutorials)
DLI Course: "Building Agentic AI Applications with LLMs" for deeper learning
Remember: The best Nemotron projects build AGENTS that reason and act - not just chatbots that respond. Think orchestration, tool-use, and autonomous problem-solving! üéâ
